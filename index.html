        <p>The carrot approach gives children something to strive for -  a clear and obtainable reward, with tasks that must be completed to receive it.</p>

        <p>This is a reference to the carrot portion of the "carrot or stick" approach - motivating through rewards rather than punishment.</p>
        <p>The earliest English-language references to "carrot or stick" come from the mid-1800s in a depiction of a race between donkey riders, with the loser beating his steed to urge it forward, while the winner sits in his saddle holding a stick with a carrot hanging in front of the donkey.</p>
